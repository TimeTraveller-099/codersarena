        <h2>What is Coding?</h2>
        <div class="what_is_coding">
        <p>Coding, in the simplest of terms, is telling a computer what you want it to do, 
        which involves typing in step-by-step commands for the computer to follow.</p></br>
        <p>Computers are not clever things, however they are very obedient. They will
        do exactly what you want them to do, so long as you tell them how to do it correctly.</p></br>
        <p>Learning to code has been likened to learning a foreign language, or perhaps more specifically 
        a family of foreign languages.</p></br>
        <p>There are many different coding languages, each one designed with certain things in mind.</p></br>
        <p>Examples include C, a ‘low level’ but fast programming language that is good for anything graphically
        intensive like games; Javascript, which was specifically designed for dealing with web content; 
        and Perl, a multi-functional language that is often referred to as the ‘swiss army knife’ of 
        programming.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section5">
        <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
        <div class="why_coding">
        <p>If you are wondering why we should learn Coding, well there are plenty of good reasons for it.
        </p></br>
        <p>For young learners, programming helps to gain problem-solving skills i.e. to solve a problem 
        in a logical as well as creative way.</p></br>
        <p>Coding also enhances thinking ability and enables one to think logically, strategically and 
        analytically.</p></br>
        <p> Code powers our digital world. Every website, smartphone app, computer programme, calculator 
        and even microwave relies on code in order to operate. This makes coders the architects and builders 
        of the digital age.</p></br>
        <p>Over the next 10 years it is estimated that there will be 1.4 million jobs in computer sciences and 
        only around 400,000 graduates qualified to do them.</p></br>
        <p>Jobs not directly linked to computer sciences – such as banking, medicine and journalism – will also 
        be affected by the need for at least an understanding of programming and coding.</p>
